# RaspberryPi_CyberCAR
 基于树莓派的四驱智能小车，低压直流电池组供电，安装多种传感器系统，实现黑线循迹、超声波避障、红外遥控、网络遥控遥感、磁轨控制、AI红绿灯识别 等功能。
 The four-wheel drive smart car based on Raspberry PI is powered by low-voltage DC battery pack, and a variety of sensor systems are installed. The functions that have been realized are: black line tracking, ultrasonic obstacle avoidance, infrared remote control, network remote control and remote sensing, magnetic track control, AI traffic light recognition and other functions.
